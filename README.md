INFO 461 Project

### Mission Statement
To bring awareness to the overuse of plastic that is endangering our oceans as a way to empower individuals to take action against plastic pollution.

### Problem Statement
When you think of an ocean, you think of clear, blue water with abundant marine life around. Unfortunately, every year approximately 19 billion pounds of plastic waste end up in our oceans, causing massive ocean pollution and endangerment of sea creatures. Many people are unaware of how much plastic they use and how this usage is affecting our worldâ€™s oceans and the marine life that inhabit them. 

If we continue to ignore this problem, more marine life will be vulnerable to unnatural deaths due to entanglement or digestion of plastic. Furthermore, there are five garbage patches within our oceans that are getting bigger each year, including the Pacific garbage patch that is currently twice the size of Texas.

To help mitigate this problem, we plan to design and develop a web-based application that can educate users on the impact of their plastic footprint while giving them advice on how to reduce plastic waste.
