1. Usefulness
  * If our application isn’t useful, then users are less likely to adopt it and change their behavior. Our goal is to encourage people to change their “plastic footprint” and become more aware of their impact, but to do so, our application must be efficient and perform well for their needs.
2. Accessibility
  * We want to educate and encourage as many people as possible to change their behaviors to solve the bigger problem of plastic pollution in the ocean, so it needs to be able to reach all people of varying abilities.
3. Learnability
  * Our product is only effective if it is used by a large number of people. If our product is not learnable, people will be less likely to use it. 
  * Also the easier it is for our users to learn our product, they more likely they will be willing to change their behavior and change how they impact the world via their use of plastics.
4. User Efficiency
  * Performing tasks on our application needs to be efficient so users will continue setting goals and changing their behavior. Interactions on our application are voluntary so they need to be efficient in order to keep users engaged and interested.
  * The faster that users can accomplish tasks, the more likely they will return to use our application in the future because it’s easy to use.
5. Reliability
  * In order for our application to effectively work towards solving the problem, we not only need a large number of users, but we also need them to stick around for a long time. If the application is reliable, it will be more user friendly for people who use it often.
6. Verifiability
  * Since our application is educational, we have to ensure that users can verify where we are taking our information from. If the users don’t believe our information, then they won’t use our app so this is a relatively high priority quality for us to consider.
7. Robustness 
  * Robustness is important so that our application is more accessible to a wider range of people. The more people using the application, the more effective it will be in solving the problem.
8. Portability
  * Almost everyone contributes to the problem of plastic pollution, so we want to be able to reach people on various platforms so they can access our application on the go or when they’re at home. 
9. Interoperability
  * This quality is only semi-important in comparison to the other ones because it is important for the user to instantly recognize widely used icons for our features for example, but if there’s a new icons that they haven’t seen before, we expect that our users can learn new things that aren’t seen in other widely used interfaces. 
  * Also it is not as important that our user interface resembles ones that users have seen before. As long as our target users can accomplish their desired tasks with relative ease, it doesn’t matter as much if they’ve seen a similar interface before. 
10. Correctness 
  * We need the software to consistently perform certain functionalities so users will stay engaged with it.
  * The functionality in the specification is designed to target plastic pollution, so it is important that we implement it correctly to stay on track with solving the problem,.
11. Performance
  * Since it is more important that our users find our application useful and reliable for example, it is of less concern that our application performs well constantly. Users may have to wait to retrieve data longer than normal, but as long as they receive this data and can use it to learn from our application, we have achieved our goal.
12. Maintainability
  * Since our goal is very long term to help educate users on plastic pollution, the application will not have major changes implemented often after the initial ones are completed so having easy to maintain code isn’t a high priority.
13. Security
  * Our application does not store any highly sensitive information of users so security is of minimal priority. However, we do have to ensure that any information we collect is stored properly, but we will only collect data such as first name, so the information doesn’t have to be under extremely high security.
14. Reusability
  * We aren’t a big corporation so it’s not necessary for us to have to reuse our code across different applications. Our goal is simply to create one application so this is the least important quality for us to consider.
